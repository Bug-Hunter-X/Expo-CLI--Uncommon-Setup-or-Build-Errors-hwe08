The solution involves ensuring all packages are up-to-date, resolving dependency conflicts, and carefully reviewing your `package.json` and `app.json` files for any misconfigurations.  The updated `package.json` should reflect the latest versions of Expo dependencies.  If dependencies conflict, tools like `npm-check-updates` can assist in identifying and resolving them.  Double-check that settings in `app.json` are correct and comply with the current Expo version.  Additionally, cleaning the project's cache using `expo prebuild --clean` can sometimes fix issues related to outdated build artifacts.
